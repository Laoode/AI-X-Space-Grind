**Current Grind: AI X Space Grind â€” 100 Days Plan**

This repository is my personal journal of learning and building expertise toward becoming an **AI Engineer in the space industry**.  
The 100-day plan balances **machine learning (ML), physics, astronomy, and space applications**, supported by hands-on portfolio projects, blogs, and daily logs.

It draws from key skills like:
- Python/ML programming  
- Data analysis  
- Physics simulations  
- AI frameworks (PyTorch, NumPy, SymPy)  
- Astronomy & space datasets
